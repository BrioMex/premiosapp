Django test project

This test project was made using Django framekork.

This allows the admin to create new surveys or polls with respective options (at least two options).

The user can go to localhost:8000/polls to vote. Onve voted, the results are shown.

The main porpouse is to get in touch with Django for backend development.

Added some html and css just to verify everything is working as planned.
